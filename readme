Why services
Components shouldn't fetch or save data directly, and they certainly shouldn't knowingly present fake data. They should focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service.

This tutorial creates a HeroService that all application classes can use to get heroes. Instead of creating that service with the 
new
keyword, use the dependency injection that Angular supports to inject it into the HeroesComponent constructor.

Services are a great way to share information among classes that don't know each other. Create a HeroService next and inject it in the HeroesComponent, to provide hero data.
